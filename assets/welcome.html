<h1>Welcome to the Solid Data Kitchen!</h1>

<p class="kitchenTourP">
The Data Kitchen is a stand-alone version of the mashlib DataBrowser.
It has a number of features and a few differences in interface not found 
in the standard version.  Please at least skim this quick tour to get an 
idea of the differenenes.
</p>

<p class="kitchenTourP hasImage">
<b>A context menu</b> integrates the DataBrowser with file management and SPARQL querying and provides extra <b>DataBrowser navigation</b>.  Right-click (ctrl-click for Mac) on any DataBrowser item or link. 
</p>

<p class="kitchenTourP hasImage">
<b>SPARQL Query</b> results are displayed as a table in which each term links back to a DataBrowser view of that term.  Queries automatically include most common prefixes so you can do something like <i>WHERE { ?subject rdfs:label ?label. }</i> without having to specify <i>PREFIX rdfs:</i> beforehand. The dialect is rdflib's subset of SPARQL.  
</p>

<p class="kitchenTourP hasImage">
The <b>file manager</b> supports saving or moving documents and entire document trees between your local file system and remote pods. 
If you have configured <b>external editors</b> (e.g. Protege, emacs), the context menu will let you open the selected resource in the editor.
</p>

<p class="kitchenTourP">
<b>Session Management</b> :Logging in is not needed for read/write of local resources or read of public resources. For writing to protected pods, use the login button. If you configure identities using the settings editor, you can auto-fill the login form from your pre-defined identites. Change identities on the fly, or even open two different data-kitchen windows with two identites simultaneously.  Chat with yourself!
</p>

<p class="kitchenTourP">
<b>Specifying URIs</b> : In the dataBrowser URI bar, the start of the URI and the end of the URI determine how the URI will be interpreted.  Shortcuts use the
localBase and remoteBase settings in the Settings Manager.
</p>
<p>
URI starts with
<style>
li em {
 display:inline-block;
 width:3em;
}
</style>
<ul>
  <li><em>http</em> - absolute remote or localhost web address</li>
  <li><em>file</em> - absolute local file system address</li>
  <li><em>app</em> - absolute in-browser address (e.g. IndexedDB)</li>
  <li><em>/</em> - remote address relative to REMOTE_BASE</li>
  <li><em>./</em> - local file system address relative to LOCAL_BASE</li>
  <li><em>@</em> - address of an ontology (see below)</li>
</ul>

URI ends with
<ul>
  <li><em>/</em> - URI is a container (folder,directory)</li>
  <li><em>anything else</em> - URI is a resource (file,document)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Ontology shortcuts
<ul>
 <li>
 If the URI is in the form @prefix:term where prefix is an RDF prefix
 known to the Solid namespace, it will be expanded to the full URI.
 For example, @ldp:Container will bring you to http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container.
 If you want to start out at the top level of the ontology, leave off
 the colon and term.  For example, "@ldp" brings you to http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp
 </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Local Profile</b> : The dataBrowser expects to find key Solid resources (profile, settings, etc.)
in the "myPod" folder of the data kitchen installation folder.  You may edit 
these resources, but make sure that, at a minimum, your profile is located in
the myPod/profile folder and it points to a preference file in myPod/settings.
These profile settings (for example, your role as a PowerUser or Developer)
will inform your DataBrowser experiences when browsing local files.  If you browse remote files, your experience will depend on your profile (or lack of one) on the site you are visiting.
</p>

<p class="kitchenTourP">
External editors, login identities, bookmarks, shortcuts, as well as other features of the kitchen may all be modifed using the <b>Settings Manager</b> on theKitchen menu.
</p>


<p class="kitchenTourP">
<h3>Known Issues</h3><ul>
<li>
For HTML and nonRDF text that are protected by an ACL, the Dokeli and HumanReadable Panes may show 401 errors even if you are logged in.  The source and other panes should all work even if the Dokieli and HumanReadable panes don't. You can access these panes by logging in a second time with the button in the Pane itself (not the login button at the top of the data-kitchen page).
</li>
<li>
On windows, local audio and video may not play and login may not be possible.
</li>
</ul>
