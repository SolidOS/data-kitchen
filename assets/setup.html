<h1>Setting up a local profile</h1>

<p>
The dataBrowser expects to find key Solid resources (profile, settings, etc.)
in the root folder of your file system.  If it does not find them, the 
dataBrowser will behave differently.  If you want your preferences to be 
honored (e.g. are you a Developer or PowerUser?), copy the following folders
from the kitchen-data/myPod folder:
<ul>
<li>common (folder and contents)</li>
<li>profile (folder and contents)</li>
<li>settings (folder and contents)</li>
<li>.well-known (folder and contents)</li>
<li>.acl (file)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You can, if you wish use your profile and other resources from a remote pod instead of the supplied items.  If you do this, make sure that addresses are relative.  Also, make sure that the top level .acl gives access to </profile/card#me>.
</p>
<p>
You can also edit these files as you would on a pod.
</p>
<p>
You can also add other items (e.g. inbox) for special purposes.
