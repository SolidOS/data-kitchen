<h1>Solid Data Kitchen</h1>

<p><em>A stand-alone data browser for everyone and everything</em></p>

<p>
This project provides a kitchen where the user is cook, and
the power user is chef.
Live your life in a read-write world of linked data!
</p>
<p>
Use all your solid pods, including your local files as your zeroth pod.
Bring in all the stuff in your life shared by friends and colleagues.
Bring in public data like dbpedia and wikidata and the LOD cloud.
