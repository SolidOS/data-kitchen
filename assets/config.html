<h1>How to customize the Solid Data Kitchen</h1>

Copy <em>installFolder/config.default.json</em> to <em>installFolder/config.json</em>. Then edit the following fields:

<h2>Window size and position</h2>

<blockquote>
Position can be either "center"  or an integer (no quotes).
</blockquote>

<h2>Start Page</h2>

<blockquote>
Leave as an empty sting to start with the Data Kitchen intro page or set it to any URI.
</blockquote>

<h2>LOCAL_BASE</h2>
<blockquote>
This variable allows you to use "./" as a shortcut in the dataBrowser.
If LOCAL_BASE is set to "/home/me/", a request in the dataBrowser URI 
bar for ./foo.txt will find the file "file:///home/me/foo.txt". You
could have gotten to the same place by using that full URI.  If this
variable is missing or empty, it will default to the "myPod" folder of your
installation folder.
</blockquote>

<h2>REMOTE_BASE</h2>
<blockquote>
This variable allows you to use "/" as a shortcut in the dataBrowser.
If REMOTE_BASE is set to "https://me.example.org/public/", a request 
in the dataBrowser URI bar for "/foo.txt" will look for the resource
at "https://me.example.org/public/foo.txt". You could have gotten to
the same place by using that full URI.  If this variable is missing 
or empty, you will not be able to use this shortcut.

<h2>Customize Bookmarks and Menus</h2>
<blockquote>
In progress. For now, you can edit it in main.js if you wish.
