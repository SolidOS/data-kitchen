<h1>How to customize the Solid Data Kitchen</h1>

Note: Eventually these should all be managed via RDF.

<h2>Window size and position</h2>

<blockquote>
Edit the relevant keys in the createWindow function in main.js.
</blockquote>

<h2>Start Page</h2>

<blockquote>
Edit the START_PAGE variable in the renderer.js file in the installation folder.
This defaults to the Data Kitchen intro page, but you can set it to any URI.
</blockquote>

<h2>Menus & Bookmarks</h2>

<blockquote>
Edit the TEMPLATE array in the main.js file in the installation folder
</blockquote>

<h2>File Root</h2>
<blockquote><p>
Edit the FILE_ROOT variable in the rendererer.js file in the installation folder.
</p><p>
This is the document root of the local fileSystem, similar to an HTTPD 
document root - if fileRoot is "/home/me/", then a URL of file:///public/
will be mapped onto the folder at /home/me/public/.  The default
fileRoot is the myPod folder of the installation. You can change it to
any folder on your filesystem, including, if you wish and are able, the 
root folder "/".
</p><p>
The fileRoot is not only the root folder for browsing, it is where Data
Kitchen will look for your profile and preferences exactly as it does on
a pod.  So you should recursively copy all of the files and folders in
the myPod folder to your new fileRoot. So if you set the fileRoot to /home/me/, 
copy ${installation folder}/myPod/* to /home/me/.
