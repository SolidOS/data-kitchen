You are looking at a folder in the installation folder of 
data-kitchen.  You are by no means limited to this folder, 
you may access any part of your file system you have access 
to, including the root file:///.  See the Help item about
configuration to learn how you can configure the meaning of 
the ./ shortcut to point anywhere you'd like.  Regardless
of how that shortcut is set, you have data-kitchen access 
anywhere you have access to just by using an absolute URI.
